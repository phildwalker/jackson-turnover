So what are our next steps from here?


# Additonal Information to Capture 

1. Would love to capture more information about exits to better track. One that would be interesting is capturing when we have 'regrettable loss', or better detailing what characteristics would make an exit more regettable for the organization.
1. Would be interesting to bring in the exit interview data to augment the analysis to dig further into employee's decisions to leave. 


# Testing Hypotheses

1. We would want to measure the turnover after we make this policy change to determine if it had the intended affect.
    * Know that this would be a long feedback loop as we would want to wait at least a month before testing again.
    * Could utilize a chi-sqare test to test for differences.
