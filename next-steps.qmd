So what are our next steps from here?

1. Would be interesting to bring in the exit interview data to augment the analysis to dig further into employee's decisions to leave. 
2. We would want to measure the turnover after we make this policy change to determine if it had the intended affect.
    * Know that this would be a long feedback loop as we would want to wait at least a month before testing again.
    * Could utilize a chi-sqare test to test for differences.
