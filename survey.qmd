title: "Survey Responses"
---

This is where we will provide an analysis into the survey responses in order to determine if we see a correlation between survey responses and the ultimately the employee's decision to leave the company or not


This is a space where we'd be interested to tease out the difference's between different demographics and whether or not their responses are indicitive of different behaviors.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| error: false
library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_bw())
jcolor <- c("#5a2158", "#983560", "#cb575e", "#ee8757", "#febe57", "#f9f871")

surv <- readRDS(file = here::here("data", "survey_long.RDS"))


surv |> 
  ggplot(aes(Response))+
  geom_bar(stat = "count", aes(fill = Year), position = "dodge")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = jcolor) +
  facet_wrap(Question_Type ~ .)+
  labs(title = "Count of Responses by Year for each survey group") + 
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#F8F5F5"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#F8F5F5")
  )

```

We see a shift in responses from more negative in 2021 -> more positive in 2025
