## Additional Analysis: Correlation to Voluntary

It would be interesting to add a view into if the survery responses are more connected to voluntary or involuntary turnover.

* It's possible that both groups are unsatisfied but it you would want to know if one of the survery response is more connected to a certain group or not.
* It's also possible that the involuntary turnover employees were statisfied and there were more caught off-guard as a result of their terminations

```{r, overall-response}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| error: false
library(tidyverse)
source(here::here("src", "_initial_settings.R"))

emp_clean <- readRDS(file = here::here("data", "employee.RDS"))
surv <- readRDS(file = here::here("data", "survey_long.RDS"))

most_recnt <- 
  surv |> 
  group_by(ID, Question_Type) |> 
  filter(Year == max(Year)) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Question_Type, values_from = Response) |> 
  right_join( ,y= emp_clean |> select(ID, Term_Type),
              by = join_by(ID)) |> 
  mutate(term = ifelse(is.na(Term_Type), 0, 1))

# Survey Responses

### Note 
The Engagement Data file contains associate responses to four survey items.

* OverallSat_[Year] – Overall, I am extremely satisfied with Jackson as a place to work.
* Recommend_[Year] – I would recommend Jackson as a great place to work.
* ThinkLeave_[Year] – I rarely think about looking for a job at a different company.
* Pride_[Year] – I feel proud to work at Jackson.

Engagement survey items were rated using a 5-point rating scale:

* 5 = Strongly Agree
* 4 = Agree
* 3 = Neither Agree nor Disagree
* 2 = Disagree
* 1 = Strongly Disagree

We see a shift in responses from more negative in 2021 -> more positive in 2025

## Responses vs Turnover 

All 4 of the survey repsonses are decently correlated with terminations.

* Because the correlations are negative, we would say that in general that the lower the response (closer to strongly disagree) that the higher the likelihood of an employee exiting. 

```{r, correlation-spearman}
#| echo: false

#| fig-cap: "Correlation of Survey Response to Termination"

# Calculate Spearman's rank correlation for each ordinal variable
# correlation is [-1,1]

# cor_s1 <- cor.test(most_recnt$term, most_recnt$OverallSat, method = "spearman")$estimate
# cor_s1

correlations <- most_recnt %>%
  rename(Surv_OverallSat = OverallSat, Surv_Recommend = Recommend, Surv_ThinkLeave = ThinkLeave, Surv_Pride = Pride) |> 
  select(starts_with("Surv_")) %>% # Select all ordinal variables
  map_df(~cor(most_recnt$term, ., method = "spearman", use = "pairwise.complete.obs"), 
         .id = "variable") %>%
