One that would be interesting is capturing when we have ‘regrettable loss’, or better detailing what characteristics would make an exit more regettable for the organization.\nWould be interesting to bring in the exit interview data to augment the analysis to dig further into employee’s decisions to leave.\nFor our employee enagement survey, it would be helpful to think about gathering more detailed feedback around employee perceptions. (ie something like: “are you fairly compensated for the work you perform?”, with the goal of understanding how an across the board raise might impact their perceptions).\n\n\n\nTesting Hypotheses\n\nWe would want to measure the turnover after we make this policy change to determine if it had the intended affect.\n\nKnow that this would be a long feedback loop as we would want to wait at least a month before testing again.\nCould utilize a chi-sqare test to test for differences.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to consider:\n\nWould a 6% raise even impact employee satisfaction\n\nHow would it compare to the cost of living due to inflation?\nWould questions in the employee engagement survey could capture employee perception here?"

    "text": "Presentation last built on: 2025-10-14\n\n\n\nNote from Phil\nI am aiming to provide a clear and instructive analysis to Sr Leadership, mixing both written prose and visuals to provide an artifact for later viewing as well as a tool to center the conversation for this decision. I will start with the high level recommendation and then provide the steps for how we get there, knowing that depending on the leader’s availability, sometimes there is only time for the analysis and sometimes it’s desired to know how we got to the answer.\nI have intentionally designed this to be a code driven analysis in order to ensure that both the analysis is reproducible as well as that the code is reusable. It has been a common occurance for me where I have provided an analysis, we’ve made a decision and then a year later we want to evaluate the results. By this solution being code based, we are able to quickly recreate the analysis and update with the necessary data without having to wonder if some data was omited due to outliers or if we intentionally just focused on a specific population.\nBecause this presentation is meant for Sr Leadership I have intentionally removed most code, except for situations where it would be instructive or in more of of the detailed appendix. If you would like to review the code, please visit the code repository on Github by clicking on the icon on the top right and navigating to the “Source Code” link.\nThanks for following along!\n-phil walker\n\n\nAnalysis Overview\n\nProblem Statement:OutcomesData SouresAssumptions\n\n\nBelow is the provided problem statement. This is what we will use as our driving focus for this analysis.\n\nYou are a Senior HR Data & Insights Consultant and have been asked to assist senior HR leadership make a decision regarding a planned policy change.\n\n\n\nSenior leadership is concerned with the on-going impact the pandemic and “Great Resignation” has had on the workforce. There is a pervasive belief that turnover has been steadily on the rise over the past five years, and recent high-profile terminations among some of the organization’s top performers have raised questions regarding the organization’s retention strategy.\nSenior leaders believe compensation is driving turnover and have proposed implementing an across the board annual raise of 6% at the start of next year to counteract the effect of inflation.\nYou have one week to clean, review, and analyze the provided data to help senior leadership understand the current turnover landscape, the cost of their proposal, and whether the proposed retention strategy will have the desired impact.\n\n\n\n\nThe following are the outcomes of this analysis. Also provided are the links to the locations of the outcomes.\n\nWhat’s the turnover picture?\n\ntdlr; 2022 and 2023 saw significantly higher turnover, but it’s been returning back to pre-pandemic rates.\nDetailing the current turnover rate -&gt; Turnover Analysis\n\nWhat’s driving exits?\n\nAre the survey responses correlated to employee exits?\n\ntdlr; there was a shift in reponses from 2021 to 2023 + 2025\nDetails in survey reponses -&gt; Survey Analysis\n\nAre their certain employee characteristics that are more likely to exit?\n\ntldr; it’s more likely that —-\nDetails of employees -&gt; Employee Characteristics\n\n\nWhere to now?\n\nNext Steps\nSuggestions for additional data to capture\nQuestions for further discussion\n\n\n\n\nFor this analysis we will be using the following data sources:\n\nHRIS Data - Employee tenure and Demographics\n\nProvided by employeer\n\nHRIS Data - Employee Survey Response\n\nProvided by employeer\n\nBLS - JOLTS\n\nfiltered down to Finance and Insurance category -&gt; looks at nationwide rates\n\nBLA - Inflation (Consumer Price Index)\nMichigan Job\nMichigan Workforce Reports\nNashville Workforce Reports\n\n\n\n\nTerminology\n\nI am equating exits = terminations = turnover = quits = separation\nI know that the BLS distinquishes between layoffs/ terminations (involuntary) and quits (voluntary)\n\nCalculations\n\nAverage Employees Per Month: Uses the # at the start of the month\nTurnover = # Resigned/ Avg Employee\n\nFor this analysis we are also going to remove Temporary employees.\nWe recognize that there have been a large economic shift where more employees are staying at their companies, if we were to make a policy change we would want to differentiate between (and look for a causal link) between the policy and the company’s turnover.\nIdentify top performers as:\n\nthose with a performance rating of 4 or 5\n\nAssuming that employees that are that employees with the effective date of the current job are _____\nJackson’s NAICS code is 524113 (designates Direct Life Insurance Carriers)\n\nfalls under the “Finance and Insurance” sector.
