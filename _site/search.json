    "text": "Trend of Exits\nTo start our understanding of employee turnover trends we are first looking at the monthly exits trended from 2018 to now and then we have calculated the year turnover rates.\n\nWe see the trend of exits (as well as yearly turnover rates) saw a significant change from pre-pandemic levels during both 2022 and 2023.\nWhile 2025 YTD turnover is still higher than pre-pandemic levels, the average monthly levels have significantly decreased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to understand more about the drivers of the increases in 2022 and 2023, we will then dig into the different characteristics of our employees.\n\n\nAnalysis Overview\n\nExits:Voluntary vs InvoluntaryTurnover rateNext Steps\n\n\nWhat population is seeing the largest impact?\n\nLooking into the population of employees within 2022-2023 vs 2018-2022\nWe’re going to use an anova to\n\n\ntermd &lt;- emp_dates |&gt; \n  filter(Term_Date &gt;= as.Date(\"2018-01-01\")) |&gt; \n  left_join(., y=emp_clean, by = join_by(ID))  |&gt; \n  filter(ActiveEmp == 0) \n\ntermd |&gt; count(Department)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  Department          n\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;int&gt;\n1 Finance           126\n2 Human Resources    59\n3 IT                235\n4 Marketing          57\n5 Operations        468\n6 Sales             241\n\ntermd |&gt; count(Location)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Location          n\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n1 Lansing, MI     798\n2 Nashville, TN   388\n\ntermd |&gt; count(Job_Level)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  Job_Level                  n\n  &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;int&gt;\n1 Executive                121\n2 Individual Contributor   808\n3 Management               257\n\ntermd |&gt; count(Associate_Type)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  Associate_Type     n\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n1 Regular         1186\n\ntermd |&gt; count(Time_Type)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Time_Type     n\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1 Full time  1133\n2 Part time    53\n\ntermd |&gt; count(FLSA)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  FLSA           n\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n1 Exempt       878\n2 Non-Exempt   308\n\ntermd |&gt; count(Race_Ethnicity)\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 2\n  Race_Ethnicity                                n\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                     &lt;int&gt;\n1 American Indian or Alaska Native              7\n2 Asian                                       255\n3 Black or African American                   192\n4 Hispanic or Latino                          144\n5 Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander     3\n6 Not Specified                                37\n7 Two or More Races                            52\n8 White (Not Hispanic or Latino)              496\n\ntermd |&gt; count(Gender)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  Gender                            n\n  &lt;chr&gt;                         &lt;int&gt;\n1 Female                          463\n2 I choose not to self-identify    84\n3 Male                            615\n4 Nonbinary                        24\n\ntermd |&gt; count(MostRecent_Performance)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  MostRecent_Performance                n\n  &lt;chr&gt;                             &lt;int&gt;\n1 Below Expectations                  385\n2 Consistently Below Expectations      61\n3 Consistently Exceeds Expectations    14\n4 Exceeds Expectations                194\n5 Meets Expectations                  532\n\ntermd |&gt; count(Term_Type)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Term_Type       n\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 Involuntary   322\n2 Voluntary     864\n\n\n\n\nDo we see a change in the ratio of involuntary vs voluntary terminations over time?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s the yearly turnover rates from 2018 to now\n\n\n\nDetailing the current tur\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\nThe initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed within ‘src/clean_employee.R’ which can be found within the source code.\nI built “monthly_employee.R” as a function that could be called to get the active number of employees per month given a dataset like this HRIS sample. This would allow for a quick recreated of monthly view when we are testing future policy impacts."

    "text": "So what are our next steps from here?\n\nAdditonal Information to Capture\n\nWould love to capture more information about exits to better track. One that would be interesting is capturing when we have ‘regrettable loss’, or better detailing what characteristics would make an exit more regettable for the organization.\nWould be interesting to bring in the exit interview data to augment the analysis to dig further into employee’s decisions to leave.\n\n\n\nTesting Hypotheses\n\nWe would want to measure the turnover after we make this policy change to determine if it had the intended affect.\n\nKnow that this would be a long feedback loop as we would want to wait at least a month before testing again.\nCould utilize a chi-sqare test to test for differences."

    "text": "Presentation last built on: 2025-10-13\n\n\n\nNote from Phil\nI am aiming to provide a clear and instructive analysis to Sr Leadership, mixing both written prose and visuals to provide an artifact for later viewing as well as a tool to center the conversation for this decision. I will start with the high level recommendation and then provide the steps for how we get there, knowing that depending on the leader’s availability, sometimes there is only time for the analysis and sometimes it’s desired to know how we got to the answer.\nI have intentionally designed this to be a code driven analysis in order to ensure that both the analysis is reproducible as well as that the code is reusable. It has been a common occurance for me where I have provided an analysis, we’ve made a decision and then a year later we want to evaluate the results. By this solution being code based, we are able to quickly recreate the analysis and update with the necessary data without having to wonder if some data was omited due to outliers or if we intentionally just focused on a specific population.\nBecause this presentation is meant for Sr Leadership I have intentionally removed most code, except for situations where it would be instructive or in more of of the detailed appendix. If you would like to review the code, please visit the code repository on Github by clicking on the icon on the top right and navigating to the “Source Code” link.\nThanks for following along!\n-phil walker\n\n\nAnalysis Overview\n\nProblem Statement:OutcomesData SouresAssumptions\n\n\nBelow is the provided problem statement. This is what we will use as our driving focus for this analysis.\n\nYou are a Senior HR Data & Insights Consultant and have been asked to assist senior HR leadership make a decision regarding a planned policy change.\n\n\n\nSenior leadership is concerned with the on-going impact the pandemic and “Great Resignation” has had on the workforce. There is a pervasive belief that turnover has been steadily on the rise over the past five years, and recent high-profile terminations among some of the organization’s top performers have raised questions regarding the organization’s retention strategy.\nSenior leaders believe compensation is driving turnover and have proposed implementing an across the board annual raise of 6% at the start of next year to counteract the effect of inflation.\nYou have one week to clean, review, and analyze the provided data to help senior leadership understand the current turnover landscape, the cost of their proposal, and whether the proposed retention strategy will have the desired impact.\n\n\n\n\nThe following are the outcomes of this analysis. Also provided are the links to the locations of the outcomes.\n\nDetailing the current turnover rate -&gt; Turnover Analysis\n\ntdlr; 2022 and 2023 saw significantly higher turnover, but it’s been returning back to pre-pandemic rates.\n\nDetailing if there are certain groups with higher turnover\nDetermine if the higher turnover is correlated to the responses in the employee engagement survey\nWould a 6% raise even impact the cost of living due to inflation?\n\n\n\nFor this analysis we will be using the following data sources:\n\nHRIS Data - Employee tenure and Demographics\n\nProvided by employeer\n\nHRIS Data - Employee Survey Response\n\nProvided by employeer\n\nBLS - JOLTS\nBLA - Inflation (Consumer Price Index)\nMichigan Job\nMichigan Workforce Reports\nNashville Workforce Reports\n\n\n\n\nCalculations\n\nAverage Employees Per Month: Uses the # at the start of the month\nTurnover = # Resigned/ Avg Employee\n\nWe are extracting part time employees from the population as we would expect the turnover rate to be different for these populations\nFor this analysis we are also going to remove Temporary employees.\nWe recognize that there have been a large economic shift where more employees are staying at their companies, if we were to make a policy change we would want to differentiate between (and look for a causal link) between the policy and the company’s turnover.\nIdentify top performers as:\n\nthose with a performance rating of 4 or 5\n\nAssuming that employees that are that employees with the effective date of the current job are _____\nJackson’s NAICS code is 524113 (designates Direct Life Insurance Carriers)\n\nfalls under the “Finance and Insurance” sector.
