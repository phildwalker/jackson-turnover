    "text": "Note from Phil\n\n\n\n\n\nI aim to provide a clear and instructive analysis for senior leadership, combining written insights with visuals to create both a lasting reference and a tool to guide discussion around this decision. I will begin with the high-level recommendation, followed by the steps that lead to it, recognizing that depending on leadership’s availability, there may be time only for the key findings or, alternatively, interest in understanding the full analytical process.\nThis analysis is intentionally code-driven to ensure it is both reproducible and reusable. I’ve often encountered situations where, after an analysis leads to a decision, we later want to revisit the results. By structuring this work in code, we can easily recreate the analysis and refresh it with updated data—without worrying about whether any data was previously omitted or if a particular subset was intentionally emphasized.\nBecause this presentation is designed for senior leadership, I have excluded most of the underlying code, except in cases where it adds instructional value or appears in the detailed appendix. If you’d like to review the full code, please visit the GitHub repository by clicking the icon in the top right and selecting the “Source Code” link.\nThank you for joining as we explore the turnover data!\n-phil walker\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis Overview\n\nProblem Statement:OutcomesData SouresAssumptions\n\n\nBelow is the provided problem statement. This is what we will use as our driving focus for this analysis.\n\nYou are a Senior HR Data & Insights Consultant and have been asked to assist senior HR leadership make a decision regarding a planned policy change.\n\n\n\nSenior leadership is concerned with the on-going impact the pandemic and “Great Resignation” has had on the workforce. There is a pervasive belief that turnover has been steadily on the rise over the past five years, and recent high-profile terminations among some of the organization’s top performers have raised questions regarding the organization’s retention strategy.\nSenior leaders believe compensation is driving turnover and have proposed implementing an across the board annual raise of 6% at the start of next year to counteract the effect of inflation.\nYou have one week to clean, review, and analyze the provided data to help senior leadership understand the current turnover landscape, the cost of their proposal, and whether the proposed retention strategy will have the desired impact.\n\n\n\n\nThe following are the outcomes of this analysis. Also provided are the links to the locations of the outcomes.\n\nWhat’s the turnover picture?\n\ntdlr; 2022 and 2023 saw significantly higher turnover, but it’s been returning back to pre-pandemic rates.\nDetailing the current turnover rate -&gt; Turnover Analysis\n\nWhat’s driving exits?\n\nAre the survey responses correlated to employee exits?\n\ntdlr; there was a shift in reponses from 2021 to 2023 + 2025\nDetails in survey reponses -&gt; Survey Analysis\n\nAre their certain employee characteristics that are more likely to exit?\n\ntldr; The strongest correlate to exits was the most recent performance rating.\nDetails of employees -&gt; Employee Characteristics\n\n\nWhat’s the cost to implement this proposed policy?\n\ntldr; The projected cost would be between $11.6M - $13M\nDetails of policy cost -&gt; Policy Cost\n\nProject policy impact -&gt; Policy Impact\n\nWhere to now?\n\nNext Steps\nSuggestions for additional data to capture\nQuestions for further discussion\n\n\n\n\nFor this analysis we will be using the following data sources:\n\nHRIS Data - Employee tenure and Demographics\n\nProvided by employeer\n\nHRIS Data - Employee Survey Response\n\nProvided by employeer\n\nBLS - JOLTS\n\nfiltered down to Finance and Insurance category -&gt; looks at nationwide rates\n\nBLS - Consumer Price Index (CPI) + Employement Cost Index (ECI)\n\nCPI is often used to characterize the inflation rate\nECI aims to capture the change in the cost of labor (eg wages, salaries, benefits) &lt;!– - BLA - Inflation (Consumer Price Index)\n\nMichigan Job\nMichigan Workforce Reports\nNashville Workforce Reports –&gt;\n\n\n\n\nTerminology\n\nAcross the analysis, I am equating exits = terminations = turnover = quits = separation\nWhile, I know that the BLS distinquishes between layoffs/ terminations (involuntary) and quits (voluntary), I decided to utilize a more conversational tone.\n\nCalculations\n\nAverage Employees Per Month: Uses the # at the start of the month\nTurnover = # Resigned/ Avg Employee\nAs noted in the instructions, I am using 2080 hr as FTE when converting hourly rate to a yearly amount.\n\nFor this analysis we are also going to remove Temporary employees.\nJackson’s NAICS code is 524113 (designates Direct Life Insurance Carriers)\n\nfalls under the “Finance and Insurance” sector.

It would be interesting is capturing when we have ‘regrettable loss’ (beyond a voluntary termination), or better detailing what characteristics would make an exit more regettable for the organization. 1. Would be interesting to bring in the exit interview data to augment the analysis to dig further into employee’s decisions to leave. 1. For our employee enagement survey, it would be helpful to think about gathering more detailed feedback around employee perceptions. (ie something like: “are you fairly compensated for the work you perform?”, with the goal of understanding how an across the board raise might impact their perceptions).\n\n\nTesting Hypotheses\n\nWe would want to measure the turnover after we make this policy change to determine if it had the intended affect.\n\nKnow that this would be a long feedback loop as we would want to wait at least a month before testing again.\n\n\n\n\nOther considerations\n\nThe peaks in 2022 and 2023 likely also have a company policy connected to them, especially for the involuntary turnovers. While this is harder to store, capturing this business decision in a structured format would be helpful for future analyses."
