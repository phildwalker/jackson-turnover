Outside of that, the other factors don't look to be strongly correlated.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](employee-char_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Correlation Funnel: Voluntary or Involuntary\n\nAgain the performance rating seems to be more correlated to the type of termination (voluntary vs involuntary) \n\n* Being rated a 1 or 2 are more correlated to involuntary termination\n* Employees who exited, who were rated a 3 or 4 tended to be the voluntary terminations \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](employee-char_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){fig-align='center' width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Notes\n\nThe correlation funnel comes from the correlationfunnel R package. It essentially performs One Hot Encoding for categorical variables or bins numeric (and then performs One Hot Encoding off those bins).\nFrom those variables, it then performs a correlation using the Pearson method\n\n:::",
