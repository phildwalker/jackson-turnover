We see that a 6% raise would put an employee a few points above the projected inflation, though it's likely that many of these employees already weathered the high inflation in 2022 and 2023 without necessarily having similar raises so it is likely that they are still feeling the impacts of a few years ago.\n\n\n## Projected CPI / Employment Cost Index\n\n![](img/Deloite_EmploymentCost-CPI_Figure16.jpg)\n\nsource: [Deloite Economic Outlook](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/us-economic-forecast/united-states-outlook-analysis.html)\nThis data is originally sourced from the BLS",
