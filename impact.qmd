## Additional Analysis: Cost of Living

According to the MIT Living Wage Calculator:

For a family of 4, the salary to live comfortably would be:

* In Lansing, MI: $95k
* In Nashville, TN: $110k

# Analysis Overview

```{r, char-init}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| error: false
library(tidyverse)

source(here::here("src", "_initial_settings.R"))
source(here::here("src", "monthly_employee.R"))

emp_clean <- readRDS(file = here::here("data", "employee.RDS"))
emp_dates <- readRDS(file = here::here("data", "employee_dates.RDS"))
```

There's a couple of ways to interpret this question.... 

* We are looking to answer if we generally see a decrease in voluntary turnover as a result of higher raises

* Would an increase of 6% get an employee to the general cost of living in their respective areas?
  * Cost of living would be dependent on the employee's living situation but for the stake of this analysis we are assuming that 

* Are high performers (as Exceeds or Consistently Exceeds Expectations)
