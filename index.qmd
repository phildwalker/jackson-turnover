# Note from Phil

I aim to provide a clear and instructive analysis for senior leadership, combining written insights with visuals to create both a lasting reference and a tool to guide discussion around this decision. I will begin with the high-level recommendation, followed by the steps that lead to it, recognizing that depending on leadership’s availability, there may be time only for the key findings or, alternatively, interest in understanding the full analytical process.

This analysis is intentionally **code-driven** to ensure it is both **reproducible** and **reusable**. I’ve often encountered situations where, after an analysis leads to a decision, we later want to revisit the results. By structuring this work in code, we can easily recreate the analysis and refresh it with updated data—without worrying about whether any data was previously omitted or if a particular subset was intentionally emphasized.

Because this presentation is designed for senior leadership, I have excluded most of the underlying code, except in cases where it adds instructional value or appears in the detailed appendix. If you’d like to review the full code, please visit the GitHub repository by clicking the icon in the top right and selecting the **“Source Code”** link.

Thank you for joining as we explore the turnover data!

# Analysis Overview

::: panel-tabset
## Problem Statement:

Below is the provided problem statement. This is what we will use as our driving focus for this analysis.

> You are a Senior HR Data & Insights Consultant and have been asked to assist senior HR leadership make a decision regarding a planned policy change.

> 1.  Senior leadership is concerned with the on-going impact the pandemic and “Great Resignation” has had on the workforce. There is a pervasive belief that turnover has been steadily on the rise over the past five years, and recent high-profile terminations among some of the organization’s top performers have raised questions regarding the organization’s retention strategy.
> 2.  Senior leaders believe compensation is driving turnover and have proposed implementing an across the board annual raise of 6% at the start of next year to counteract the effect of inflation.
> 3.  You have one week to clean, review, and analyze the provided data to help senior leadership understand the current turnover landscape, the cost of their proposal, and whether the proposed retention strategy will have the desired impact.

## Outcomes

The following are the outcomes of this analysis. Also provided are the links to the locations of the outcomes.

-   **What's the turnover picture?**
    -   *tdlr;* 2022 and 2023 saw significantly higher turnover, but it's been returning back to pre-pandemic rates.
    -   Detailing the current turnover rate -\> [Turnover Analysis](turnover.qmd#exit-trend)
-   **What's driving exits?**
    -   Are the survey responses correlated to employee exits?
        -   *tdlr;* there was a shift in reponses from 2021 to 2023 + 2025
        -   Details in survey reponses -\> [Survey Analysis](survey.qmd#overall-response)
    -   Are their certain employee characteristics that are more likely to exit?
        -   *tldr;* The strongest correlate to exits was the most recent performance rating.
        -   Details of employees -\> [Employee Characteristics](employee-char.qmd#overall-response)
-   **What's the cost to implement this proposed policy?**
    -   *tldr;* The projected cost would be between $11.6M - $13M

## Data Soures

For this analysis we will be using the following data sources:

-   HRIS Data - Employee tenure and Demographics
    -   Provided by employeer
-   HRIS Data - Employee Survey Response
    -   Provided by employeer
-   [BLS - JOLTS](https://www.bls.gov/jlt/)
    - filtered down to Finance and Insurance category -> looks at nationwide rates
-   BLS - Consumer Price Index (CPI) + Employement Cost Index (ECI)
    - CPI is often used to characterize the inflation rate
    - ECI aims to capture the change in the cost of labor (eg wages, salaries, benefits)

    
<!-- -   [~~BLA - Inflation (Consumer Price Index)~~](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/)
-   [~~Michigan Job~~](https://www.milmi.org/)
-   [~~Michigan Workforce Reports~~](https://www.michigan.gov/mdcs/quick-links/workforcereports)
-   [~~Nashville Workforce Reports~~](https://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.tn_nashville_msa.htm) -->

## Assumptions

- Terminology
    * Across the analysis, I am equating exits = terminations = turnover = quits = separation
    * While, I know that the BLS distinquishes between layoffs/ terminations (involuntary) and quits (voluntary), I decided to utilize a more conversational tone.

-   Calculations
    -   Average Employees Per Month: Uses the \# at the start of the month
    -   Turnover = \# Resigned/ Avg Employee
    - As noted in the instructions, I am using 2080 hr as FTE when converting hourly rate to a yearly amount. 

-   For this analysis we are also going to remove Temporary employees.

-   Jackson's NAICS code is 524113 (designates Direct Life Insurance Carriers)
    -   falls under the "Finance and Insurance" sector. (Sector 52)
